biteR requires the following packages. Sometimes development versions of packages do not install dependencies, so I suggest you install and attach these first.

    survey,
    car,
    utils,
    data.table,
    plyr

Using the Packages tab Install function, or manually, install the biteR package from the biteR_0.1.tar.gz source file.

There is a single wrap-around bite function with one parameter:  the path to the input .csv file:  bite(file_name = "<file_name>").  Results should look something like what follows.

For documentation, suggest you start with >package?biteR and >?bite
